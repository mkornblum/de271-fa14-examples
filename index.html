		<h1>Cakes I Enjoy</h1>
		<p>I have enjoyed many different cakes in my life. 
		I would like to tell you about some of them here.</p>

		<h2>Chocolate Cake</h2>
		<p>Chocolate cake is best when it's very dark chocolate, however milk chocolate
		is sometimes OK. Some things that are really good when paired with chocolate
		cake are:</p>
			
		<ul>
			<li>Cold Milk</li>
			<li>Coffee or Tea</li>
			<li>Ice Cream</li>
			<li>Peanut Butter</li>
			<li>Fudge</li>
			<li>More Chocolate</li>
			<li>Sprinkles</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Red Velvet</h2>

		colored with beets.</p>
